# Bloom Filter

My first C# project. I wanted to implement something I learned about in school a long time ago using async programming, something I've recently gotten interested in. I wanted to share it here to get feedback from people who know more than I do. I would love advice from anyone experienced with async programming in C#, especially on locking.
